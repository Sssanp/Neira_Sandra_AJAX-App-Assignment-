## History
>Working based on the last earbuds website assignment and randomiser_api example previously created in class I got this API to work, I also added a spinner from the internet and some images.
## Features
* `Connect & Pull Data from API`: Utilizes the Fetch API to connect to the specified API endpoints and retrieve data.
* `Output JSON Data & Use Template Element`: Processes and displays JSON data using the HTML <template> element for efficient rendering.
* `Implement Loading Spinner and Error Response for User`: Implements a loading spinner to provide visual feedback during data retrieval and incorporates error handling to notify the user in case of data loading failures.
